# North Carolina Healthcare Costs and Outcomes 
##More files needed to be added
## Description 
This is a NC healthcare costs data repository that extracts a sub dataset from a bigger, [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:4af217e5-2988-404f-81f4-526b0c66502b) file, seeking to observe how socioeconomic status can impact healthcare outcomes. The data looks at the median household income, healthcare costs, and the percentage of people that couldn't see a doctor due to these costs. By correlating median household income and healthcare costs, the repository seeks to offer insights into how economic factors affect health services utilization. Furthermore, users are able to use this dataset for things such as public health planning as well. 

## Getting Started 
To get started with this repository, view the files provided and download the ones needed for your own use to either use the data or re-create similar computational methods. Download the .csv file if you wish to use the data already extracted, otherwise click on the ipynb file `Healthcare_Costs.ipynb` and download it by clicking the three dots. You can use the csv file embedded within this README file to recreate similar computational methods.

## Future Outcomes
Potential future outcomes for this repository can include studying ways to mitigate heathcare costs and bring the percentage of "people that couldn't see a doctor due to cost" down. Through this, it can help identify areas or communities that are negatively affected by healthcare costs, which can guide towards initiatives to help such areas.
