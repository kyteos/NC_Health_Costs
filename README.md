# North Carolina Healthcare Costs and Outcomes 

## Description 

This is a NC healthcare costs data repository that extracts a sub dataset from a bigger csv file, which seeks to observe how socioeconomic status can impact healthcare outcomes. The data looks at the median household income, healthcare costs, and the percentage of people that couldn't see a doctor due to these costs. By correlating median household income and healthcare costs, the repository seeks to offer insights into how economic factors affect health services utilization. Furthermore, users are able to use this dataset for things such as public health planning. 

## Getting Started 

## Future Outcomes

Future potential: The data about the percentage of people unable to see a doctor due to costs can bring forth public health initiatives. Through this, it can help identify areas or communities that are negatively affected by healthcare costs, guiding targeted interventions.

Potential future outcomes for this repository can include studying ways to mitigate heathcare costs and bring the percentage of "people that couldn't see a doctor due to cost" down. The sub dataset for this repository was extracted from the [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:4af217e5-2988-404f-81f4-526b0c66502b) file.
